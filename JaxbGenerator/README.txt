OpenRoberta reads XML generated by blockly and creates an AST for further code generation.
This process is facilitated by using jaxb2 to create a Java bean tree matching the XML tree.

Java > 9 has removed jaxb support (xjc, parts in rt.jar). Thus building for Java 8 ... Java 11 is not stable anymore.
See the (german) blog https://blog.viadee.de/jaxb-und-soap-in-Java-11 for a more detailed description.

As the xsd was stable for years, we decided to separate the generation process from the use.
The project containing this README is used to generate the beans needed. After a change in the xsd the beans have to be (re-)generated
and copied manually into the OpenRobertaRobot project. The generation here expects a Java8 JDK.

All other projects can be processed with any Java >= 8.

If you have a better solution to this (removing Java 8 at all is NO solution at the moment [Oct 2019]), please send mail to

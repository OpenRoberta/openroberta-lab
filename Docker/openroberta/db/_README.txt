The databases (i.e.: the directory with the database files) associated 1:1 with a server are stored here. Expect directories as 'test', 'dev', etc.
The dir 'dbAdmin' stores db logging and db backups. The directory 'dbEmpty' contains an empty database. Note, that (as usual), this database may be
an older version. But the database upgrading process during server start should take care of this.
